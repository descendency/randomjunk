The purpose of this program is to make decisions within the code. This is an important concept for everything from error checking to advanced form processing. Just about every program longer than 20 lines doing more than printing will use some form of conditional logic.

Like all previous programs, it is highly encouraged to type the program in, compile it, and run before reading the explanation.

In p4, I listed all of the imports on individual lines with import keywords starting them. You can also shorten it as lines 3-9 do with parenthesis.

In the main function, This program asks for a number and then tells you whether it is positive, negative, or zero. Lastly, it outputs a truth table like output to show comparisons.

Line 27 demonstrates a new type primitive, bool. Bool variables are true or false. If the user input 3, then positive would be true because 3 > 0.

Lines 29-38 are part of an if/if-else/else statement. if and else are both keywords. if statements execute code if the clause is true.

The syntax is `if clause {`. The clause is a boolean type.
Code within the braces ({}) only executes if the clause is true. If it is false, any else (or if-else) clauses will be checked.

Else clauses only execute if all if and if-else clauses are false.

If-else and else clauses are optional.

Practice Objective:
    - Rewrite this program to only use if clauses.
