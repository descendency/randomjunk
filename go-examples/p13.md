This program will demonstrate how to write cleaner code with structs being involved. There is a technique to writing functions that work with structs that will be covered. This technique applies to all Object-Oriented languages like Java and C#. This will help the code read more naturally and make it more obvious later when you break your code into multiple files (the main way to make your code more readable).

Like all previous programs, it is highly encouraged to type the program in, compile it, and run before reading the explanation.

To save some time, we will look at a similar example to p12.go except p13.go will change the functions to 'methods' of the person struct. Methods are the name for functions that require an instance of a struct to be created to use them, as you will see.

I dropped an extra file into the list of programs. It is a Tic-Tac-Toe game. There are a few concepts in this that have not been covered yet (Random Numbers and Error checking), but I thought it would be interesting to see a working ('simple') game. There are plenty of similar games that can be implemented. (for example, Connect Four)
