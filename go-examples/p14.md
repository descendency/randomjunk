Like all previous programs, it is highly encouraged to type the program in, compile it, and run before reading the explanation.

This will come with two examples.

The first example will explain what an interface is and the second will explain why we use interfaces instead of specific variable types.

Example 1:
This first example comes from http://gobyexample.com.

In this example, we have two types (lines 13-18) that represent two types of 2D shapes. Both the rect and circle types have methods to calculate their area and their perim(eter).

If I want to display this information on the screen, I have to call their individual functions and print that to the screen. This means I would have to write two more methods (one per struct) to print this information.

An interface is a named way to tell the compiler that a struct type has at least a collection of methods. Those structs may have more than just these, but they have at least the methods. Inside of the interface is a list of function definitions (lines 9-10).

Now, in the main function we see a rect and a circle variables created (lines 41-42). These variables are then passed to a function "measure()" which will print their measurements to the screen.

However, if you look at line 34, you will notice that the function definition says measure() takes a geometry type, not a rect or a circle. When the compiler sees that you pass a rect instead of a geometry, it looks to see if geometry is an interface (it is) and if the rect struct has implemented the required methods (it also has). Since the rect class has the required methods, it replaces the calls "g.area()" and "g.perim()" with calls to that rect's area() and perim() methods. A similar thing happens when measure is called with the circle on line 45, except the circle's methods are called instead.

Since all rects (and circles) are geometry types, you can call their area() and perim() methods. However, you cannot reference their variables since the geometry interface type has no variables.

Example 2:

We will look at how to write a function we've been using for a while (fmt.Print()). While there is one last concept to discuss before one can write the entire thing (errors), we can show the vast majority of it.

Note: For simplicity, I will cheat and use the actual Print function, but I doubt you want to read a bunch of code about buffering text to stdout (we will cover a concept like this later when we talk about File IO).

This program is fairly simple and should look familiar to the function "specialPrintln()" in p9.go. In p9.go, we used a string type to allow us to accept a variable number of strings to print to the screen.

However, the actual Print functions will also print any type whatsoever. This is because the fmt.Print function doesn't accept strings. It accepts something else. Going back to line 5 (in p14-2.go), we see the function "PrintFunction" accepts a variable number of type 'interface{}'... what?!?

Remember that interfaces are ways to require a variable type has a certain group of functions. What if I don't care if it has any functions? Then I can use the generic term "interface". This function accepts a list of interface types and passes them to the actual Print function. The actual print function will then figure out what type they actually are (using something called reflection... think of this like seeing what a mirror sees). It will then convert them to strings and print those strings.

The actual source code for this function is implemented here: https://golang.org/src/fmt/print.go?s=6480:6527#L221

Notice how they basically just pass the interface list to another function FPrint. That function pushes things to be printed to a specified output. In that case, it pushes it to "stdout" which is the console.

It will take a significant amount of programming to appreciate what an interface can do, when to use them, when not to use them, and the like. The main purpose of interfaces, structs, and almost everything we've done since we talked about functions has been to make code more modular.

The purpose of modular code will be discussed in the next lesson on packages.
